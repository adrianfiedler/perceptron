# perceptron

Simple self build perceptron used to classify points above or below a line of type y=x

See example here: https://adrianfiedler.github.io/perceptron/

Red dots: Wrongly classified by perceptron
Green dots: Correctly classified by perceptron

The perceptron is regularly trained to minimize the error rate
